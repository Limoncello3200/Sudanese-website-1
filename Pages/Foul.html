    Foul is a staple breakfast in Sudan, and each household has a different recipe. This is the recipe I use!
    <ul>
        <li>Ingredients</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 300g tins ofd fava beans, drained and rinsed </li>
                <li>150 ml boiling water</li>
                <li>1 tbs ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp mixed spice</li>
                <li>1 medium red onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced/li>
                <li>100 ml sesame oil (50 ml to serve)</li>
                <li>50 g salty sudanese cheese, or feta, to serve</li>
                <li>1 lime</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Directions</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a medium sized pot on low to medium heat, then add the onion and fry, semi-covered and stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes until the pieces soften and begin to golden. </li>
                <li>Add the tomato and fry for 5 minutes until it softens and breaks down, then the colour changes into a deep red.</li>
                <li>Stir in the rinsed fava beans and water. Season with the spices and salt. Bring to a gentle boil then lower to a medium to low heat for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the beans to cook and release their juices. </li>
                <li>Add the juice from half a lime. Taste and balance the flavours by adding more of any of the seasonings. Serve in a deep round bowl and crumble the salty cheese on top, sprinkle a dash of cumin, and finally drizzle the remaining sesame oil over the top. Serve with baladi and foul.</li>
            </ol>
